YugaByte DB’s sharding, replication and transactions architecture is similar to that of [Google Cloud Spanner](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/) which is also a globally-distributed CP database with high write availability. Both these databases are based on the design principles outlined in the [original Google Spanner paper](https://research.google.com/archive/spanner-osdi2012.pdf) published in 2012. Note that while Google Cloud Spanner leverages Google’s proprietary (and expensive) network infrastructure, YugaByte DB is designed work on commodity infrastructure used by most enterprise users.
